### The basics
- Learn a new programming language which is different from the ones you know already: Javascript, Go etc see https://octoverse.github.com for a list of top languages 
- Contribute to an open source project 
- Have a pet project of your own. Bonus points: open source that 
- In the summers when you're at University: work as an intern at a software development company
